Really\uff0c the largest GREen leaf in this country is a dockleaf\uff1b if one holds it before one\uff0c it is like a whole apron\uff0c and if one holds it over one's head in rainy weather\uff0c it is almost as good as an umbrella\uff0c for it is so immensely large. The burdock never grows alone\uff0c but where there grows one there always grow several\uff1a it is a great delight\uff0c and all this delightfulness is snails' food. The great white snails which persons of quality in former times made fricassees of\uff0c ate\uff0c and said\uff0c "Hem\uff0c hem\uff01 how delicious\uff01" for they thought it tasted so delicate\u2014\u2014lived on dockleaves\uff0c and therefore burdock seeds were sown.
 Now\uff0c there was an old manor-house\uff0c where they no longer ate snails\uff0c they were quite extinct\uff1b but the burdocks were not extinct\uff0c they GREw and grew all over the walks and all the beds\uff1b they could not get the mastery over them\u2014\u2014it was a whole forest of burdocks. Here and there stood an apple and a plum-tree\uff0c or else one never would have thought that it was a garden\uff1b all was burdocks\uff0c and there lived the two last venerable old snails.
 they themselves knew not how old they were\uff0c but they could remember very well that there had been many more\uff1b that they were of a family from foreign lands\uff0c and that for them and theirs the whole forest was planted. They had never been outside it\uff0c but they knew that there was still something more in the world\uff0c which was called the manor-house\uff0c and that there they were boiled\uff0c and then they became black\uff0c and were then placed on a silver dish\uff1b but what happened further they knew not\uff1b or\uff0c in fact\uff0c what it was to be boiled\uff0c and to lie on a silver dish\uff0c they could not possibly imagine\uff1b but it was said to be delightful\uff0c and particularly genteel. Neither the chafers\uff0c the toads\uff0c nor the earth-worms\uff0c whom they asked about it could give them any information\u2014\u2014none of them had been boiled or laid on a silver dish.
 the old white snails were the first persons of distinction in the world\uff0c that they knew\uff1b the forest was planted for their sake\uff0c and the manor-house was there that they might be boiled and laid on a silver dish.
 Now they lived a very lonely and happy life\uff1b and as they had no children themselves\uff0c they had adopted a little common snail\uff0c which they brought up as their own\uff1b but the little one would not grow\uff0c for he was of a common family\uff1b but the old ones\uff0c especially Dame Mother Snail\uff0c thought they could observe how he increased in size\uff0c and she begged father\uff0c if he could not see it\uff0c that he would at least feel the little snail's shell\uff1b and then he felt it\uff0c and found the good dame was right.
 One day there was a heavy storm of rain.
 "Hear how it beats like a drum on the dock-leaves\uff01" said Father Snail.
 "there are also rain-drops\uff01" said Mother Snail. "And now the rain pours right down the stalk\uff01 You will see that it will be wet here\uff01 I am very happy to think that we have our good house\uff0c and the little one has his also\uff01 There is more done for us than for all other creatures\uff0c sure enough\uff1b but can you not see that we are folks of quality in the world\uff1f We are provided with a house from our birth\uff0c and the burdock forest is planted for our sakes\uff01 I should like to know how far it extends\uff0c and what there is outside\uff01"
 "there is nothing at all\uff0c" said Father Snail. "No place can be better than ours\uff0c and I have nothing to wish for\uff01"
 "Yes\uff0c" said the dame. "I would willingly go to the manorhouse\uff0c be boiled\uff0c and laid on a silver dish\uff1b all our forefathers have been treated so\uff1b there is something extraordinary in it\uff0c you may be sure\uff01"
 "the manor-house has most likely fallen to ruin\uff01" said Father Snail. "Or the burdocks have grown up over it\uff0c so that they cannot come out. There need not\uff0c however\uff0c be any haste about that\uff1b but you are always in such a tremendous hurry\uff0c and the little one is beginning to be the same. Has he not been creeping up that stalk these three days\uff1f It gives me a headache when I look up to him\uff01"
 "You must not scold him\uff0c" said Mother Snail. "He creeps so carefully\uff1b he will afford us much pleasure\u2014\u2014and we have nothing but him to live for\uff01 But have you not thought of it\uff1f Where shall we get a wife for him\uff1f Do you not think that there are some of our species at a GREat distance in the interior of the burdock forest\uff1f"
 "Black snails\uff0c I dare say\uff0c there are enough of\uff0c" said the old one. "Black snails without a house\u2014\u2014but they are so common\uff0c and so conceited. But we might give the ants a commission to look out for us\uff1b they run to and fro as if they had something to do\uff0c and they certainly know of a wife for our little snail\uff01"
 "I know one\uff0c sure enough\u2014\u2014the most charming one\uff01" said one of the ants. "But I am afraid we shall hardly succeed\uff0c for she is a queen\uff01"
 "That is nothing\uff01" said the old folks. "Has she a house\uff1f"
 "She has a palace\uff01" said the ant. "The finest ant's palace\uff0c with seven hundred passages\uff01"
 "I thank you\uff01" said Mother Snail. "Our son shall not go into an ant-hill\uff1b if you know nothing better than that\uff0c we shall give the commission to the white gnats. They fly far and wide\uff0c in rain and sunshine\uff1b they know the whole forest here\uff0c both within and without."
 "We have a wife for him\uff0c" said the gnats. "At a hundred human paces from here there sits a little snail in her house\uff0c on a gooseberry bush\uff1b she is quite lonely\uff0c and old enough to be married. It is only a hundred human paces\uff01"
 "Well\uff0c then\uff0c let her come to him\uff01" said the old ones. "He has a whole forest of burdocks\uff0c she has only a bush\uff01"
 And so they went and fetched little Miss Snail. It was a whole week before she arrived\uff1b but therein was just the very best of it\uff0c for one could thus see that she was of the same species.
 And then the marriage was celebrated. Six earth-worms shone as well as they could. In other respects the whole went off very quietly\uff0c for the old folks could not bear noise and merriment\uff1b but old Dame Snail made a brilliant speech. Father Snail could not speak\uff0c he was too much affected\uff1b and so they gave them as a dowry and inheritance\uff0c the whole forest of burdocks\uff0c and said\u2014\u2014what they had always said\u2014\u2014that it was the best in the world\uff1b and if they lived honestly and decently\uff0c and increased and multiplied\uff0c they and their children would once in the course of time come to the manor-house\uff0c be boiled black\uff0c and laid on silver dishes. After this speech was made\uff0c the old ones crept into their shells\uff0c and never more came out. They slept\uff1b the young couple governed in the forest\uff0c and had a numerous progeny\uff0c but they were never boiled\uff0c and never came on the silver dishes\uff1b so from this they concluded that the manor-house had fallen to ruins\uff0c and that all the men in the world were extinct\uff1b and as no one contradicted them\uff0c so\uff0c of course it was so. And the rain beat on the dock-leaves to make drum-music for their sake\uff0c and the sun shone in order to give the burdock forest a color for their sakes\uff1b and they were very happy\uff0c and the whole family was happy\uff1b for they\uff0c indeed were so.
